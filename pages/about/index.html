            Project SWIMS was kicked off by the science club leaders of
            Government Bilingual Practicing High School Yaounde, Cameroon. This
            group was led by Fru-Mark Carrington Chei. They started off during
            the end of the year 2019 during the early out break of the
            Coronavirus. Mark Carrington created a team and they came up with an
            idea to ease the disposal of waste in their school in a sustainable
            manner while protecting and reducing the rate of the spread of the
            coronavirus.

            They did not just end up with the idea of limit the smart dustbin to
            just a dustbin that could open and close automatically; later on,
            they thought of furthering the idea to help contribute to their
            community, by building a dustbin that could help for waste
            collection and disposal in an efficient and sustainable manner
            thereby contributing to the UN sustainable development goal 13.

              After a lot of problem validation and research they came up with
              SWIMS in the year 2021. SWIMS means Smart Waste Intelligent
              Monitoring System. SWIMS has a mission to build economic solutions
              for problems sorrounding the waste sector. SWIMS has a unique
              mission to help avoid the climate crisis and contribute to the
              fulfilling of the goal 13 of the sustainable development goals.
              Mark and his team has gone as far as to come up with their first
              project: a hardware-software solution that will make waste
              collection and waste disposal as easy as possible and sustainable.

              Waste collection is the most difficult sector in Africaâ€™s Waste
              management system. Out of the total waste that is produced per
              year in Africa, just 20% of this collected while 80% is disposed
              of openly. Despite all the efforts waste collectors make in
              collection they are not still able to collect more waste. They
              complain that They spend more time, energy, and resources yet they
              are not still able to accomplish their collection plans. Instead,
              dustbins overflow and waste remains exposed to the environment.
              Waste collectors end up increasing their carbon footprints in the
              environment since they will need to dispatch more trucks to
              collect and spend more on fuel consumption.
