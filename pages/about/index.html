            Project SWIMS was founded in 2019 by Fru-Mark Carrington Chei and
            the science club leaders at Government Bilingual Practicing High
            School Yaounde, Cameroon. Their goal was to develop a tech-driven
            solution for waste disposal that would be sustainable, efficient,
            and environmentally friendly. Through the use of cutting-edge
            technology, the team created an innovative approach that has
            transformed waste disposal practices, both within their school and
            beyond. At SWIMS, we are proud to have been founded by such
            visionary individuals, and we remain committed to promoting
            sustainable waste management practices and protecting the
            environment through the power of technology.

            The idea behind the smart dustbin did not stop at its initial
            conception as a device that could open and close automatically.
            Instead, the creators saw an opportunity to innovate and contribute
            to their community by designing a dustbin that could facilitate
            efficient and sustainable waste collection and disposal, aligning
            with the UN's sustainable development goal 13. At SWIMS, we stand
            behind this commitment to using technology to drive positive change
            and promote environmental sustainability.

              Waste collection is the most challenging sector of Africa's waste
              management system. Despite the efforts of waste collectors, only
              20% of the total waste produced in Africa is collected each year,
              resulting in overflowing dustbins and exposed waste. This leads to
              increased carbon footprints and fuel consumption as waste
              collectors struggle to meet their targets. At SWIMS, we recognize
              these challenges and are committed to addressing them through
              innovative solutions. Our Smart Waste Intelligent Monitoring
              System streamlines waste collection and disposal practices through
              optimized routes and improved efficiencies. By leveraging
              technology, we can help waste collectors reduce their carbon
              footprints and contribute to a more sustainable future.
